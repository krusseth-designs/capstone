# Capstone Project Proposal - Karen Russeth

**PokeMath: A Gamified Learning Experience**
Technologies Used: React, NodeJS, ReactStrap, PostgreSQL

## Introduction:
I propose the development of an engaging and educational Pokemon-styled math game app named "PokeMath." This application will be crafted using React for the front end, NodeJS for the backend, ReactStrap for styling, and PostgreSQL to manage the database.

## Overview:
MathQuest is designed as a single-page game app that incorporates elements from the Pokemon universe through data sourced from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/). The primary objective is to create an entertaining yet educational experience where players can build their personalized Pokedex by solving math problems.

## Features:

**User Authentication:**
Players will have the ability to sign up and log in to the app.
User data, including first name, last name, password, and email address, will be securely stored in a PostgreSQL database.

**Pokedex Building:**
Players will draw Pokemon cards, each featuring a two-digit math problem (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) on the front.
By correctly solving the math problem and entering the answer, players add the card to their 'Pokedex' of won cards.

**Score Tracking:**
A user-friendly scorecard will be displayed to track the number of cards won.
Upon winning ten Pokemon cards of a specific type, players will earn a badge.
Database Integration:
The PostgreSQL database will store crucial player information, including the Pokemon they've won and the badges earned.

**Pokedex Organization:**
The won cards in the Pokedex will be categorized by type, enhancing the user experience.
Players can click on a card to flip it over, revealing character properties such as name, type, and abilities.

## Conclusion:
MathQuest seeks to combine the allure of Pokemon with educational value, creating an interactive and enjoyable math learning experience. Through this gamified approach, users will not only enhance their mathematical skills but also embark on an exciting journey to become Pokemon Masters.
